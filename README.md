## About

I made this for myself mainly for 2b2t and decided to make it open source.

Most of the features in the mod are exploration oriented since I don't PvP.

## Usage

Download the jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine/releases) section or build the project from source yourself.

Since nicotine is a Fabric mod you will also need the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) as well.

The default menu keybind is Right Shift, but it can be changed in the settings.
