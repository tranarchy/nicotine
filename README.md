## About

nicotine is a utility mod with its own click GUI, event system and plenty of mods to enhance your gameplay

nicotine doesn't depend on [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric)

## Usage

Download the jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine/releases) section or build the project from source yourself

Then simply just move the jar file to your Minecraft mods folder

Since nicotine is a Fabric mod you will also need the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/)

## Building

```
git clone https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine
cd nicotine

# GNU/Linux, macOS and *BSD
./gradlew build

# Windows
.\gradlew.bat build
```

You will find the built jar in `build/libs`

## GUI

The default keybind for the click GUI is **Right Shift**, you can change this any time

## Other versions

nicotine is currently made for version **1.21.7**

If you want to use nicotine with another Minecraft version you can use the [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) mod
