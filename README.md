## About

nicotine is a utility mod with its own click GUI, event system and plenty of mods to enhance your gameplay

nicotine doesn't rely on the Fabric API or 3rd party dependencies

## Usage

Download the jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine/releases) section or build the project from source yourself

Then simply just move the jar file to your Minecraft mods folder

Since nicotine is a Fabric mod you will also need the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/)

## Building

```
git clone https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine
cd nicotine

# GNU/Linux, macOS and BSD
./gradlew build

# Windows
.\gradlew.bat build
```

You will find the built jar in `build/libs`

## Default keybinds

- **GUI ->** Right Shift
- **Xray ->** X
- **Zoom ->** C 
- **Surround ->** B
- **AutoCrystal ->** R 
- **KillAura ->** K

You can change the keybinds from the click GUI any time

## Older versions

nicotine is made for the newest version of Minecraft

If you want to use nicotine on an older Minecraft version you can use the [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) mod
