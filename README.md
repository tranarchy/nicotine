## About

nicotine is a utility mod that doesn't rely on Fabric API or 3rd party dependencies

It has its own click GUI, event system and plenty of mods to enhance your gameplay

## Usage

Download the jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/tranarchy/nicotine/releases) section or build the project from source yourself

Since nicotine is a Fabric mod you will also need the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/)

- **Xray ->** X
- **Zoom ->** C
